<h2>General Requirements</h2>

<p>The University of California Berkeley Library acquires access to thousands of datasets and other databases for use by authorized users. As explained in our <a  href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/conditions-of-use-for-electronic-resources">Conditions of Use policy</a>, the terms with which you must comply when using these resources are set out in electronic resource license agreements that the Library signs with each publisher. It is the responsibility of each authorized user to ensure that their use of electronic resources does not breach the terms and conditions specified in the license agreements.</p>

<p>While license terms and conditions vary from publisher to publisher, in general the following uses are NOT permitted, and these restrictions typically govern your use of any data you access through Dataverse:</p>
<ul><li>use of robots or intelligent agents to do systematic, bulk, or automatic downloading of content in violation of a license agreement, except if permitted for text and data mining;</li>
<li>systematic downloading or printing of large portions of content;</li>
<li>using e-resources for commercial purposes (including reselling, redistributing, or republishing licensed content). This includes using resources for internships and/or outside work not connected with degree requirements such as a practicum.</li>
<li>transmitting, disseminating, or otherwise making content available to unauthorized users (e.g. sending to mailing lists or electronic bulletin boards)</li>
<li>removing, obscuring, or modifying any copyright or other notices included in the materials</li>
<li>retaining data past the expiration of the license agreement</li>
<li>sharing passwords/log-in information with unauthorized users</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, publishers also require that your citations attribute them or their database as the source of the data.</p>
